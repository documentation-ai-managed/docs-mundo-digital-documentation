## Versioning and History Tracking

Every edit creates a version snapshot. You view, compare, and restore previous versions from the page settings.

<Expandable title="Advanced Version Management" default-open="false">

  Access history via the page menu. Compare diffs side-by-side.

  <CodeGroup tabs="CLI,API">
    ```bash
    md-docs version list --page "managing-documentation"
    md-docs version restore 5f3a2b1
    ```
    ```javascript
    await docs.versions.list({ pageId: "page-123" });
    await docs.versions.restore("version-abc456");
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

</Expandable>

| Action | Description | Shortcut |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| View History | See all versions | `Cmd/Ctrl + H` |
| Compare Versions | Diff two snapshots | Select versions |
| Restore Version | Revert to past state | Click **Restore** |

<Callout kind="alert">
  Enable auto-save to prevent data loss during long editing sessions.
</Callout>

## Search and Export Features

Search across all pages with full-text indexing. Export single pages or entire sites to PDF, HTML, or Markdown.

Use filters for titles, tags, or content types.

```javascript
// Example search query
const results = await searchDocs({
  query: "authentication",
  filters: { type: "guide", tags: ["api"] }
});
console.log(results); // Array of matching pages
```
